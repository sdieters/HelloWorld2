**Compatibility**

This version is compatible with **ArcGIS 10.3.** It is **not backwards
compatible** with earlier versions of ArcGIS, but should be forward
compatible with **ArcGIS 10.4.**

The most recent compatible version of Google Earth (standard and Pro) is
v7.1.2.2041. Newer versions can be used. But the user must install
v7.1.2.2041 and then the newer version. In this case the newer version
must be manually opened before using GoogleView.

Version v7.1.2.2041 of Google Earth and Google Earth Pro can be
downloaded from:

**Support**

These tools are provided "as-is". They were written and tested for
ArcMap 10.3, within the Microsoft .Net 4 framework under the Windows 7
operating system. The majority of the development work has been
undertaken by the GIS Systems and Development section of the Land
Tasmania. If you are seeking assistance you can email
[mailto:gissd@dpipwe.tas.gov.au](mailto:gissd@dpipwe.tas.gov.au) but
please be aware that the tools have been developed primarily for
internal DPIPWE staff, and hence our ability to provide support to
external users is limited.
