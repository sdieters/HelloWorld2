# DPIPWE_Tools_Addin#

This ESRI Addin toolbar provides access to a variety of web based services: theLIST, Google Earth and ArcGIS Online. These services are focused on the Australian state of Tasmania. This Addin is provided by [Land Tasmania](http://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/land-tasmania").


[**TheLIST**](http://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/land-tasmania/the-list")  is a contemporary online service that provides access to integrated land and property information service. [LISTMap](http://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/land-tasmania/the-list/listmap) allows users to view and create maps from hundreds of authoritative spatial datasets, and find out more about the information shown on those maps.

Spatial datasets include natural resources, roads, community facilities, property boundaries (cadastre), aerial imagery and survey information.

LISTMap is publicly available through your computer's web browser or via your mobile device.

The DPIPWE_Tools_Addin has single click buttons for loading either the Tasmanian colour topographic base-map, or the statewide ortho-photo mosaic from LISTMap into ArcMap. The user can also link to other LIST web services via ArMap’s catalog. A view of LISTMap with the same extent as ArcMap extent can be loaded into your browser. A version of theLIST search service is provided that finds and highlights feature.

For more detailed information on how to access LIST web services, see the following [GitHub documentation](https://github.com/DPIPWE/list-spatial-web-service-examples/blob/master/Documentation/LIST_Spatial_Web_Services_User_Guide.pdf)

**Google Earth** on your PC can be invoked with a view that matches the current ArcMap frame extent.

Connect to **ArcGIS Online** public data with a single button click.

## History

The ESRI-Addin presented here was created within the GIS Systems and Development (Spatial Operations) section of the [Land Tasmania](http://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/land-tasmania) within the Department Primary Industries Parks Water and Environment [DPIPWE](http://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/). In the course of our support for internal clients we have developed several ArcMap tools. These have been gathered together onto a single ESRI toolbar Addin. After being tested and used within the Spatial Operations section, this Addin was released to DPIPWE in 2015. It was first released to the wider community via this GitHub account in July 2016.

## Development

DIPWE_Tools_Addin was developed for ArcGIS 10.3, for the .Net 4.0 framework under the Windows 7 operating system. The code is written in VB.Net with ArcObjects SDK for .Net from ESRI using Visual Studio 2012.

## Disclaimer

DPWE_Tools_Addin is released to the wider community “as-is”. Although our testing and usage has been extensive, this experience has been with a limited number of different computer environments. Thus we cannot guarantee in any way that it will work the same way in your environment. Bear in mind that these tools have been developed primarily for internal DPIPWE staff, and hence our ability to provide support to external users is limited.
